    <p>The quadratic formula is:</p>
    n quantum field theory, a quantized field is described by a set of harmonic
    oscillators, each of which corresponds to a different mode of the field. The
    quadratures of a quantized field are the position and momentum operators
    associated with each oscillator. More specifically, for a one-dimensional
    field with mode function $\phi(x)$, the position and momentum operators are
    defined as: $$\hat{x} = \int dx \phi(x) \hat{a}^\dagger(x) \hat{a}(x)$$
    $$\hat{p} = i \int dx rac{\partial}{\partial x} \left(\phi(x)
    \hat{a}^\dagger(x) \hat{a}(x) ight)$$ where $\hat{a}^\dagger(x)$ and
    $\hat{a}(x)$ are the creation and annihilation operators for the mode with
    wavefunction $\phi(x)$. The quadratures satisfy the canonical commutation
    relation: $$1 = i \hbar$$ where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. This
    relation reflects the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which implies that
    the more precisely one measures the position of the field, the less
    precisely one can know its momentum, and vice versa.
