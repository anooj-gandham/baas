However, it changed in the third decade of this millennium with at least three shocks hitting the global economy since 2020. The shocks started with the pandemic-induced contraction of the global output, followed by the Russian-Ukraine conflict leading to a worldwide surge in inflation. The central banks across economies led by the Federal Reserve responded with synchronised policy rate hikes to curb inflation. This led to the widening of the Current Account Deficits (CAD) and increased inflationary pressures in net importing economies. The rate hike and persistent inflation also led to a lowering of the global growth forecasts for 2022 and 2023 by the IMF in its October 2022 update of the World Economic Outlook.","The frailties of the Chinese economy contributed to weakening the global growth forecasts. China's slowdown could lead to a financial contagion emanating from the advanced economies where the debt of the non-financial sector has risen the most since the global financial crisis.","The Indian economy has staged a full recovery in FY22 after its encounter with the pandemic, positioning itself to ascend to the pre-pandemic growth path in FY23. The measures taken by the government and RBI, along with the easing of global commodity prices, managed to bring retail inflation below the RBI upper tolerance target in November 2022. Despite challenges such as the depreciating rupee, the expected increase in policy rates by the US Fed, and widening of CAD, agencies worldwide still project India as the fastest-growing major economy at 6.5-7.0 per cent in FY23. This optimistic growth forecast stems in part from the resilience of the Indian economy, as seen in the rebound of private consumption seamlessly replacing the export stimuli as the leading driver of growth.","The uptick in private consumption has also given a boost to production activity resulting in an increase in capacity utilisation across sectors. The rebound in consumption was engineered by the near-universal vaccination coverage overseen by the government that brought people."]},"43":{"headings":["Economic Survey 2022-23","Decline in inventory overhang in housing market","Increase in capital expenditure and credit supply to MSME sector","Improvement in rural welfare indicators","Global growth projection and its impact on India's CAD"],"explanations":["The Economic Survey for the year 2022-23 highlights the growth drivers of the Indian economy in the current year, including the increase in private consumption, capital expenditure, and credit supply to the MSME sector. The growth in consumption has been facilitated by the vaccination drive, which has boosted consumer sentiment and enabled the return of migrant workers to cities to work in construction sites, thus spilling over into the housing market. Private Capex is expected to increase with the strengthening of the balance sheets of the Corporates and the consequent increase in credit financing it has been able to generate. The survey also highlights that if inflation declines in FY24 and if real cost of credit does not rise, then credit growth is likely to remain brisk. The recovery of MSMEs is proceeding apace, and schemes like ECGLS, MGNREGS, PM-Kisan, and PM Garib Kalyan Yojana have helped in ensuring food security in the country.","The inventory overhang in the housing market has witnessed a significant decline to 33 months in Q3 of FY23 from 42 months last year. This can be attributed to the rebound in consumption, which has spilled over into the housing market, facilitated by the vaccination drive that has boosted consumer sentiment and enabled the return of migrant workers to cities to work in construction sites.","The Capital Expenditure (Capex) of the central government increased by 63.4% in the first eight months of FY23, crowding in the private Capex since the January-March quarter of 2022. A sustained increase in private Capex is also imminent with the strengthening of the balance sheets of the Corporates and the consequent increase in credit financing. The credit growth to the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector has been remarkably high, over 30.6%, on average during Jan-Nov 2022, supported by the extended Emergency Credit Linked Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) of the Union government.","The results of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) show improvement in rural welfare indicators from FY16 to FY20, covering aspects like gender, fertility rate, household amenities, and women empowerment. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has been directly providing jobs in rural areas and indirectly creating opportunities for rural households to diversify their sources of income generation.","Global growth has been projected to decline in 2023 and is expected to remain generally subdued in the following years as well.

The Covid-19 pandemic was the first challenge of the third decade that hit global growth. The recent Russia-Ukraine conflict and monetary tightening by nations to rein in inflation caused the growth to weaken. China's policies and loss of education and income-earning opportunities posed medium-term challenges to growth.

This has strengthened the inflationary pressures that the global economic recovery had triggered, backed by massive fiscal stimuli and ultra-accommodative monetary policies undertaken to limit the output contraction in 2020. Inflation in advanced economies, which accounted for most of the global fiscal expansion and monetary easing, breached historical highs. Rising commodity prices also led to higher inflation in the emerging market economies, which otherwise were in the lower inflation zone by virtue of their governments undertaking a calibrated fiscal stimulus to address output contraction in 2020.","The conflict between Russia and Ukraine in the past two years has caused commodity prices to soar.

The reason behind this significant increase is the enlarged capital budget (Capex) of the central government and its public sector enterprises, which is rapidly being deployed. The Capex multiplier estimated for the country suggests that the economic output of the country is set to increase at least four times the amount of Capex.","Apart from the central government, states, in aggregate, are performing well with their Capex plans.

A Capex thrust in the last two budgets of the Government of India was not an isolated initiative meant only to address the infrastructure gaps in the country. It was part of a strategic package aimed at crowding-in private investment into an economic landscape broadened by the vacation of non-strategic PSEs (disinvestment) and idling public sector assets.","Three developments support crowding-in private investment into the economic landscape. First, the significant increase in the Capex budget in FY23, as well as its high rate of spending. Second, the direct tax revenue collections have been highly buoyant, and so have GST collections, which should ensure the full expending of the Capex budget within the budgeted fiscal deficit. Third, the pick-up in private sector investment since the January-March quarter of 2022. Evidence shows an increasing trend in announced projects and capex spending by the private players.

This inflation rate is not high enough to deter private consumption and is not low enough to weaken the inducement to invest. The anchoring of inflationary expectations has been ensured with moderately high inflation preventing prices from weakening demand and growth in India. The declining path of inflation is likely to decrease the interest cost of domestic credit, further inducing an increase in demand for credit by corporates and retail borrowers.","India's growth is inclusive when it creates jobs.

The Periodic Labor Force Survey confirms the urban unemployment rate for people aged 15 years and above has declined from 9.8% in the quarter ending September 2021 to 7.2% one year later (quarter ending September 2022). This is accompanied by an improvement in the labor force participation rate (LFPR), confirming the emergence of the economy out of the pandemic-induced slowdown early in FY23. Job creation has moved into a higher orbit with the initial surge in exports, a strong release of the 'pent-up' demand, and a swift rollout of the capex.","It is essential that capex continues to grow to facilitate employment and job creation in the economy until the global economy rebounds and provides an additional window to India for job creation through the export channel. Thankfully, the private sector has all the necessary pre-conditions lined up to step up to the plate and do the capex heavy lifting.

The country’s stock markets had a positive return in CY22, unfazed by withdrawals by foreign portfolio investors. India’s inflation rate did not creep too far above its tolerance range compared to several advanced nations and regions. A relatively higher growth forecast among major economies, projected retail inflation only slightly higher than the tolerance limit, and an estimated current account deficit financeable with normal capital inflows and forex reserves large enough to finance close to a year’s imports are clear evidence of economic resilience amidst a global crisis.

Entrenched inflation may prolong the tightening cycle and keep borrowing costs high, leading to low growth in FY24. If the current account deficit widens further, there may be depreciation pressure on the currency.","The limited health and economic fallout from the current surge in Covid-19 infections in China, inflationary impulses from reopening China's economy, and recessionary tendencies in major AEs triggering a cessation of monetary tightening and a return of capital flows to India could lead to an improvement in animal spirits and provide further impetus to private sector investment.","The survey projects a baseline GDP growth of 6.5 per cent in real terms in FY24, which is comparable to estimates provided by multilateral agencies such as the World Bank, the IMF, and the ADB, as well as RBI domestically.

The launch of the Golden Quadrilateral project in the 2000s was the beginning of infrastructure-intensive policymaking in India, which continued sedately for another decade. In the last few years, the government has taken a quantum leap in policy commitment and outlay for infrastructure, leading to the government's capital expenditure as a percentage of GDP on the rise. This has helped cushion economic growth when the non-financial corporate sector was unable to invest due to balance sheet troubles, and laid a good platform for crowding in private investments and growth in the coming decade.","The dedicated programs for road connectivity, port infrastructure, electrification, railways upgradation, and operationalizing new airports/airroutes have significantly improved the physical infrastructure in the last few years.

The Real Estate Regulatory Authorities across the country have disposed off more than 1.06 lakh complaints. With 99262 projects and 71514 agents already registered under RERA, the Act incentivises more investments into the sector.","Another significant reform to enhance doing business has been the decriminalisation of minor economic offences under the Companies Act of 2013. By introducing civil liabilities for dealing with simple defaults that do not involve fraud or where the nature of the lapse is purely procedural, the government has demonstrated its intent to promote ease of doing business for domestic and global investors. Furthermore, a trust-based approach towards compliance builds entrepreneurs’ faith in corporate institutions and motivates them to adopt fairer and more transparent business practices. After the reform, more than 1400 default cases have been decided without resorting to the court. Also, more than 4,00,000 companies have willingly rectified past defaults to avoid penalties under the Companies Act.","Total penal provisions reduced from 134 to 124 after decriminalisation. Compoundable offences reduced from 81 to 31. Non-compoundable offences remained the same at 35.

These reforms augur well for future economic growth and future resource mobilisation in the economy.","The government's policy in the post-2014 period has been the engagement with the private sector as a partner in the development process. The government’s disinvestment policy has been revived in the last eight years with stake sales and the successful listing of PSEs on the stock market. During FY15 to FY23, an amount of about ₹4.07 lakh crore has been realised as proceeds from disinvestment through 154 transactions. Privatisation of Air India re-ignited the privatisation drive which has improved labour productivity and overall efficiency of the PSUs.","The New Public Sector Enterprise Policy has been introduced to minimise the presence of the government in the PSEs to only a few strategic sectors. This policy is aimed to realise higher efficiency gains.","The PLI scheme will significantly boost production, exports and employment in the medium term. Sector-specific Production Linked incentives have been introduced in the aftermath of the pandemic to incentivise domestic and foreign investments and to develop global Champions in the manufacturing industry. Early estimates of the impact of PLI show encouraging trends in some sectors. For instance, the PLI scheme for large-scale electronics manufacturing has attracted an investment of ₹4,784 crore and contributed to a total production of ₹2.04 lakh crore, including exports of ₹80,769 crore (as of September 2022).","The need for a dedicated government policy to support domestic industrialisation amidst foreign competition can be better appreciated from the industrialisation experiences of East Asian countries such as South Korea and Taiwan in 1960-1990. These countries supported their domestic industries during their high growth phase, while also ensuring healthy competition required for the industries to grow.","Production incentives under Aatmanirbhar Bharat also incentivise foreign investments for domestic production. The last eight years have seen further liberalisation of the policy towards foreign investors, with most sectors now open for 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) under the automatic route.

It is especially true following the recent incidence of the pandemic when the fiscal policy became an effective macroeconomic stabilisation tool globally. In India, particularly when all economic activities had reached a standstill, fiscal policy was instrumental in providing a safety net to the vulnerable, reviving the economy by boosting demand, and addressing certain domestic supply-side constraints through public investments and sustained structural reforms. The large, frontloaded packages across the countries led to over-stimulation of demand, leading to its much faster recovery. In combination with the still-existing supply disruptions and constraints, the overheating of the economy led to inflationary pressures. The conflict in Europe and the related geopolitical developments aggravated the crisis. The slowing global growth, rising interest rates, persistently high inflation rates and uncertain global environment have thus posed certain pertinent questions for fiscal-policy experts to motivate the overarching fiscal policy strategy. How to evaluate the trade-off between maintaining fiscal support to manage the continuing crisis versus withdrawing fiscal stimulus from the economy to control inflation and regain the lost fiscal space? When to do so and at what pace? While a sudden withdrawal may have costs for medium-term growth, a slow withdrawal may be inflationary and hence put upward pressure on yields, making the debt costly. Moreover, the financial markets may have less tolerance for fiscal unorthodoxy in an era of rising interest rates.","Against this backdrop, the Government of India adopted a calibrated fiscal response to the pandemic and planned to withdraw the fiscal stimulus gradually as it moves along the glide path outlined in the Budget FY22. This chapter discusses the government's fiscal strategy amidst uncertain geopolitical developments. The chapter starts with a discussion of the performance of the Union Government's finances, followed by an overview of the State finances.

In FY20, India's GDP growth slowed down due to the ongoing stress in the financial system. Slow credit growth led to slower GDP growth. The pandemic further worsened the situation in FY21 causing the nominal GDP to contract. A detailed discussion on this is available in Chapter 2 of the Economic Survey 2022-23.","As India's economic recovery advances amidst global uncertainties, the fiscal glide path illuminates the path for fiscal policy. It will ensure larger fiscal space for policy action in uncertain times. Fiscal discipline translates into a fiscal stimulus for various sections of society through lower interest rates. As governments make their fiscal situations sustainable, the risk premium embedded in their interest rates comes down, thereby lowering the cost of capital for all sections of society. For EMDE, the stimulus effect of fiscal deficit, via diminishing risk-premium, is likely greater than it is for advanced economies. Therefore, it is crucial for governments to maintain fiscal prudence, especially in an era of rising interest rates.","The Centre should continue to incentivize states for reforms and higher capital spending to ensure a stronger General government. A capex-led growth strategy will ensure sustainable debt levels in the medium term.

The development of the insurance sector is necessary to support its continued economic transformation.","The insurance market's potential and performance are generally assessed based on two parameters, viz., ‘insurance penetration' and ‘insurance density'. Insurance penetration is the ratio of total insurance premiums to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in a year, while the insurance density is the ratio of insurance premium to population, i.e.; insurance premium per capita and is measured in US Dollar. Both parameters reflect the level of development of the insurance sector in a country. In 2021, total global insurance premiums grew by 3.4%, with the non-life insurance sector registering 2.6% growth, driven by rate hardening in commercial lines in developed markets. However, in China, the largest emerging market, non-life premium volumes contracted by 0.7% due to fierce competition and rate reductions arising from de-tariffication of motor insurance.","The life insurance segment bounced back strongly in global premium growth, registering an increase of 4.5%. The US remained the largest insurance market globally with $2.8 trillion total premiums (non-life and life) in 2021, followed by China and Japan. Emerging markets are expected to outpace developed markets in the insurance industry growth this year, with emerging Asia in the lead.","De-tariffication means removing the tariff structure, allowing insurance companies to charge premiums that match the risk profiles of its consumers. Different insurance companies can charge different prices to consumers for the same risk behavior based on their business risks models and strategies."]},"151":{"headings":["Insurance Penetration in India","Growth of Insurance Industry in India","Public Listings in Insurance Industry"],"explanations":["Insurance penetration in India has increased steadily from 2.7 per cent around the turn of the millennium to 4.2 per cent in 2020 and remained the same in 2021.

However, most life insurance products sold in India are savings-linked, with just a small protection component. Hence, households remain exposed to a significant financing gap in the event of the premature death of the primary breadwinner. The insurance density in India has increased from US$ 11.1 in 2001 to US$ 91 in 2021 (density for Life insurance was US$ 69 and Non-Life insurance was US$ 22 in 2021) in keeping with the relatively faster expansion of the insurance market in the country.","During FY22, the gross direct premium of non-Life insurers (within and outside India) registered YoY growth of 10.8 per cent, primarily driven by health and motor segments.

The life insurance premium registered YoY growth of 10.2 per cent in FY22, with new businesses contributing 45.5 per cent of the total premiums received by the life insurers.

The composition and weights assigned to different commodities in the two indices add to the difference. The headline inflation based on WPI and the CPI-C started diverging in March 2021, as WPI inflation touched double digits due to unfavorable base effects while CPI-C inflation remained stable.

The two indicators of inflation again started diverging in May 2022. It was only after global commodity prices, including crude oil, softened and the effects of strong supporting domestic factors like favorable monsoon, vaccination-led economic resumption, etc., started to be felt that the wedge began to narrow, and it closed in November 2022, after 21 months. It also indicated the near completion of the pass-through of high input costs to the retail segment. The convergence between the WPI and CPI indices was mainly driven by two factors.

The recent oil price rises are proportionally smaller than the 1970s crisis, which had taken oil prices to historic highs. Also, in contrast to the 1970s crisis which was confined to oil prices, the recent crisis has seen pervasive price increases across a broader range of commodities. Prices of non-oil energy, some agricultural goods, fertilisers, and metals have all risen above their pre-pandemic levels in the current year. It further explains the role of commodity supply disruptions and how they have played a smaller role in recent price increases than in the 1970s. Global commodity supply chains have now become more efficient than in the 1970s and hence inflationary pressure can be absorbed with greater ease. However, supply disruptions could intensify over the coming year, as the war in Ukraine will lower global production of wheat, maize, and fertilisers while price caps on Russian oil and gas may reduce the supply of these products.

However, subsequently started to decline due to input costs rising on the back of rising global commodity prices. With global commodity prices declining, input costs are expected to fall and thus profit margins are expected to increase. This is expected to make the corporate sector financially stronger and optimistic about increasing net sales. RBI’s Industrial Outlook Survey for the period till Q1 of FY24 supports this optimism as it points towards increased profit margins.","Net sales are expected to rise in the private non-financial sector in India as the corporate sector experiences increased profit margins due to falling input costs.

The IRDAI has taken various steps to promote healthy growth of the insurance industry, rationalize the regulatory framework, and reduce the compliance burden of regulated entities. Towards the objective of universal insurance, the insurance regulator has taken initiatives to increase insurance penetration such that, when India celebrates 100 years of its independence in 2047, every Indian has appropriate life, health, and property insurance cover and every enterprise is supported by appropriate insurance solutions.","During FY23, IRDAI implemented measures to increase accessibility, innovation, competition, distribution efficiency, and choice availability while mainstreaming technology and moving towards a principle-based regime in the insurance sector in India. Easy entry into the insurance sector was facilitated by launching a Single Window NOC Portal (www.noc.irdai.gov.in) to aid the incorporation of an insurer without any hassles. IRDAI reduced the time taken to launch a new product in the market by eliminating the need to seek prior approval from IRDAI for a majority of Life Insurance and Health & General Insurance products.

The hotel industry closed the year 2020 with an average hotel occupancy rate of 33- 36 per cent, reflecting a decline of 32 per cent3.","However, hotel occupancy began a strong recovery in the third quarter of 2021 driven by domestic leisure travel growth, partial resumption of business travel in the country, as well as wedding and social events. Small-to-medium-sized domestic MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conference, Exhibitions) events also made a comeback, fuelling demand for hotels. The sector ended the year with an average occupancy of 42-45 per cent, up 10-13 percentage points over the previous year.","The reintroduction of travel restrictions across States at the beginning of 2022 due to the emergence of a new Covid-19 strain, Omicron, again threw the Indian hospitality sector into an upheaval. Other leisure and business travel plans were put on hold, barring critical and urgent travel as people exercised caution. The low demand resulted in an average hotel occupancy rate of 50 per cent during January-March 2022. However, due to the lower severity and hospitalisation rate of the Omicron variant, travel demand in India began its return to normalcy in March 2022.","Aiding the revival of travel demand was the high vaccination rate in the country, as also effective pandemic management that ensured speed in imposing as well as the lifting of mobility restrictions closely tracking the spread and subsiding of the virus. After a two-year hiatus, India also resumed all regular international flights at full capacity as 2021-22 came to a close. Consequently, the entire aircraft movement (cargo aircraft + passenger aircraft) in the country increased by 52.9 per cent YoY between April and November 2022, reaching 93.9 per cent of the movement recorded between April and November 2019.

Some of the factors leading to the achievement of this target were putting in place of targets by the Government, including the setting of specific targets - country-wise, product-wise, and Export Promotion Council-wise; monitoring of the targets and course correction where required. The export growth was driven by an increase in demand for products like petroleum, cotton yarn, textiles, chemicals, and engineering goods. India was able to leverage the gap in the supply of certain products in the wake of the pandemic-related disruptions and meet the global demand. Exports were also helped by favourable global commodity prices. Some of the specific schemes of the Government which have and are facilitating and encouraging exports are as follows.","This mechanism shall make payment in INR which shall be credited into the Special V ostro account of the correspondent bank of the partner country, against the invoices for the supply of goods or services from the overseas seller /supplier, while (b) Indian exporters, undertaking exports of goods and services through this mechanism, shall be paid the export proceeds in INR from the balances in the designated Special V ostro account of the correspondent bank of the partner country. The above-mentioned framework for international settlement in INR acquires significance against the backdrop of the US Fed aggressively hiking the policy rates and its hawkish stand, the consequent rallying of the US dollar to multi-decade high levels, and concomitant weakening of currencies of various EMEs including the INR. The framework could largely reduce the net demand for foreign exchange, the US dollar in particular, for the settlement of current account-related trade flows. Further, the use of INR in cross-border trade is expected to mitigate currency risk for Indian businesses. Protection from currency volatility not only reduces the cost of doing business but also enables better business growth, improving the chances for Indian businesses to grow globally. It also reduces the need for holding foreign exchange reserves and dependence on foreign currency, making Indian economy less vulnerable to external shocks. Furthermore, it initiatives to enhance trade by promoting INR as an international currency once the rupee settlement mechanism gains traction. One of the prerequisites for the emergence of an international currency is that the said currency needs to be increasingly used for trade invoicing.","Further, it could assist Indian exporters in getting advance payments in INR from overseas clients and in the longer term promote INR as an international currency once the rupee settlement mechanism gains traction. In terms of foreign exchange market turnover (daily averages), as per the BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey 2022, the US dollar is the dominant vehicle currency accounting for 88 per cent of the global forex turnover. The INR accounted for 1.6 per cent. If the INR turnover rises to equal the share of non-US, non-Euro currencies in global forex turnover of 4 per cent, INR could be regarded as an international currency, reflecting India’s position in the global economy.","The use of INR in cross-border trade is expected to mitigate currency risk for Indian businesses.

This section focuses on the adequacy of foreign exchange reserves as a critical component of the external sector. The section offers insights and answers key questions related to the assessment of adequate levels of foreign exchange reserves, factors to consider when determining reserve thresholds, and how to ensure reserve liquidity.","Foreign Exchange Reserves (FERs) are essential for maintaining exchange rates within a certain range, ensuring liquidity, and serving as a buffer against adverse economic shocks. Achieving optimal levels of reserve empowers governments to maximize the welfare of the representative consumer while ensuring effective management of debt rollover crises. Conventionally, there are three measures of adequacy of reserves: ratios of reserves to imports, to monetary aggregates, and measures of external debt (IMF, 2000).","Determining the critical threshold levels of adequate reserves is influenced by various factors that include the country's monetary and exchange rate policies, goals, and precautionary measures. According to a recent study by Arslan Yavuz et al. (2019), the drivers behind reserve accumulation have evolved from initially being precautionary to currently focusing on monetary and exchange rate policies.","Conventionally, the traditional approach for determining the adequacy of reserves was to maintain a reserve level of three months of imports or full cover of short-term debt. However, there is little empirical support for whether the adequate coverage should be three months, as opposed to say two or six (IMF, 2011). The Guidotti–Greenspan-IMF rule suggests a ratio of reserves-to-short term debt of one. The rationale is that countries' reserves should equal short-term external debt (one-year or less maturity), which translates to a reserve level that is adequate for immediate liquidity concerns.","The total foreign exchange reserves excluding gold for selected countries as presented in the table shows a rise in reserves for several countries, more so since the global financial crisis of 2008. The figures indicate that countries have invested heavily in growing their reserves as a buffer from external economic shocks.

Different indicators are used to assess the requirements of FERs for an economy, and adequate reserve levels should be considered against total resources available to meet shocks.","While foreign exchange reserves are important in preventing crises and mitigating their impact, they come at a cost. The costs borne by an economy for holding FER include opportunity cost, loss due to the value reduction in the denominated FER, and the social cost of FER which Rodrik (2006) finds amounts to close to one per cent of GDP. ","Fukuda and Kon (2010) evaluate the macroeconomic impact of reserve accumulation and find evidence that an increase in foreign exchange reserves (FER) raises external debt outstanding but shortens debt maturity. Further, in the long-run, consumption declines, and exports are promoted by encouraging a switch from the non-tradable sector to the tradable sector through higher investment and growth. ","An economy should organise its reserves FER, in terms of the optimal size and currency composition, considering the benefits, costs, and impacts of holding them. The dominant factors influencing the currency composition of FERs are the co-movement of the domestic currency with key currencies and the currency invoicing of trade (Ito, 2019); trade flows, financial flows, and currency pegs (Eichengreen, 2000). The Value at Risk (VaR) approach has also been employed to arrive at the optimal foreign exchange portfolio (Hung et al. (2008)).

For India, as of end-September 2022, Indian residents’ overseas financial assets at US$ 847.5 billion were lower by US$ 73.0 billion or 7.9 per cent compared to the level as of end-March 2022, mainly due to the reduction in reserve assets even as trade credit and overseas direct investment recorded an increase.

International liabilities at US$ 1,237.1 billion as of end-September 2022 were lower by US$ 41.6 billion (3.2 per cent) as compared to the level as of end-March 2022. This fall was attributed primarily to direct investment (net) outflows, while variations in the exchange rate of the rupee vis-a-vis other currencies also had an impact on the change in liabilities when valued in US$ terms. The share of debt liabilities in total external liabilities was 50 per cent as of end-September 2022. Thus, the net claims of non-residents on India, valued at US$ 389.6 billion as of end-September 2022, increased by US$ 31.4 billion over the level as of end-March 2022.
